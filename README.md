This is a simple url shortener app with minimal frontend (literally a single page) that uses nodejs and npm packages along with mongodb to shorten urls. I assumed that it's a project for Egyptian audience, and made sure it's pretty user friendly by using the Egyptian dialect in a very casual manner. 

The key tool that made this project possible is [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid))
